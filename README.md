<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Use the batch file to run the hoi4utils.HOIIVUtils.jar, as the jar file tends to immediately close.
<br> Currently you need Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 17 or greater. Java SDK/JDK also should work.

<b>I  strongly recommend</b>  using git/Github to back up your mod. I assume no responsibility if
this application corrupts/breaks or inadvertently or incorrectly alters any personal files or other, or
causes any other issues. It <i>should</i> not, but of course, the program is complicated, and by using this
application, you acknowledge that you understand the risks of use, <i> especially if your mod files are not sbacked up in some form.</i>

Some features are WIP, and may not work as intended.s
