<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Use the batch file to run the hoi4localizer.jar, as the jar file tends to immediately close.
<br> You need Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 17 or greater. Java SDK/JDK also should work.

To report bugs mention me in the North America Divided server, or my discord id: BattleSkorpion#0679
<br> Some features are WIP.
