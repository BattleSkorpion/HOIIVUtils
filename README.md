**WIP!** we are working on several things including:

- providing the jdk/jre along with the program.
- making an installer
- Changing where the settings save
- Several Util Windows that are already listed in the main window  
- A proper log and console
- Learn how to use containers and test on linux
- Not require a hoi4 mod source directories to see what the app can do.
